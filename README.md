Odin shopping cart project.
I was quite lazy to think of what products to place there, so i just went with generic names and lorem ipsum stand-ins instead.
Spending energy on understanding new concepts and technichies seemed more important.
Still was a blast to do. I could have done much more, but i'd prefer to move on to next thing.
I also entirely forgot about testing and then app was done. Oops.
